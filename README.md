# AI Weather App
Introducing a powerful weather application that combines advanced features with cutting-edge technologies. Developed using React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, Apollo GraphQL, and StepZen, this app offers a seamless and immersive weather tracking experience.

With its responsive user interface and modern design, the app provides an intuitive and visually appealing interface that adapts to any device. Real-time weather data integration ensures accurate forecasts and up-to-date information. Users can rely on the app's precise weather predictions to plan their activities with confidence.

Customizable settings allow users to personalize the app according to their preferences, ensuring a tailored experience. Interactive maps provide a dynamic visualization of weather conditions, allowing users to explore and understand the forecast better.
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# Technologies used in developing the AI Weather App:

React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Next.js: A framework for server-side rendering and building React applications.
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for creating modern and responsive designs.
JavaScript: The programming language that powers the app's functionality.
Chat GPT: OpenAI's powerful language model that enhances the app's conversational capabilities.
Apollo GraphQL: A robust GraphQL client that enables efficient data fetching and integration.
StepZen: A data integration platform that simplifies connecting multiple data sources.
## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
